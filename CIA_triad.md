## 🔐 CIA Triad Overview

The **CIA Triad** stands for:
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access.  
- 🧮 **Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and unaltered.  
- 🚦 **Availability**: Ensure data is accessible when needed.  

This triad forms the foundation of modern cybersecurity.

## 🔒 1. Confidentiality

- **Definition**: Keeping data safe from unauthorized access.
- **💡 Analogy**: Your social media account is like a vault — strong passwords and MFA protect it.
- **🛠️ Security Tools**:  
  - 🔐 **Encryption**: Locks your data like a digital safe.  
  - ✅ **MFA**: A 2-step method to verify your identity.

## 🧾 2. Integrity

- **Definition**: Ensuring data is accurate and hasn’t been altered.
- **🔧 Tools for Integrity**:
  - 🧾 **Hash Functions**: Like a fingerprint for your data, ensuring it hasn’t been changed.
  - 🔏 **Digital Signatures**: Verifying the source and integrity of a file.
